Small metal disks which are attached to the scalp with wires are named as Electrodes. These Electrodes can analyze electrical impulses and conduct those signals to a computer then the results are stored or modified as the user desired.</p>\n<h3 id=\"history-of-eeg\"><a href=\"#history-of-eeg\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>History of EEG</h3>\n<p>When we consider about the history of EEG first test of the bioelectrical phenomena is found in 1791.

These are few examples of how noise generated in EEG tests</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noise generated from surrounding electromagnetic signals other than the brainwaves.</li>\n<li>Muscle artifacts can also be prominent when the measuring the waves which becomes noise in the feed signal.</li>\n<li>Blink artifacts are attributed to alterations in conductance arising from contact of the eyelid with the cornea.</li>\n<li>Moreover sweat can also be an interference by react with electrodes and changing the impedance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of the noise large set of subjects need to extract useful informations from a set and noise removal or filtering is needed.</p>\n<p>It needs a long time to prepare for the test. Adding saline or gel to electrodes place them in correct places is a long and tiresome process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"frequency-bands-in-eeg\"><a href=\"#frequency-bands-in-eeg\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Frequency bands in EEG</h3>\n<p>Mainly there are 4 types of brainwaves divided from frequency bands:</p>\n<p>| Delta |      &#x3C; 4 |\n| Theta |   4 &#x3C;= and &#x3C; 8|\n| Alpha |    8 &#x3C;= and &#x3C; 14|\n| Beta  |     >= 14|</p>\n<p>Other than these main four there can be sub frequencies which are introduced on research purpose by researchers.</p>\n<p>Studying these brainwave patterns and by adding advanced computer science techniques people has done many inventions such as controlling drones, toy vehicles, emotion recognition, lie detectors etc. It seems the day we feel and control <strong>“The force”</strong> is not so far.</p>\n<p>References:\nEMOTION DETECTION FROM EEG SIGNALS:\nCORRELATING CEREBRAL CORTEX ACTIVITY WITH MUSIC EVOKED EMOTION\nBy E.
