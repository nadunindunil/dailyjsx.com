Gitter is a chat service where all the developers and contributors of the project discuss their problem and progress of the development in open. Anyone who enters to the chat can see the conversation.</p>\n<p>Another smart move is opening a topic under your project in Stack-overflow. Then developers can discuss about the questions and improvements under your project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tryout-demo\"><a href=\"#tryout-demo\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tryout demo</h3>\n<p>Try out demo can be another help for developers and users to understand the problem you are addressing from your project and how it works in easy and more efficient way.

Good marketing will lead your project for good community and contributions.</p>\n<p>In order to be open, the first and main factor a person required is the mindset that prepares to share his knowledge with other developers. However, some might think this as a bold move not because the person is sharing his knowledge but because the amount of money that person can earn from selling the idea. However, benefits like recognition among open source culture is something that you cannot take from money.</p>\n<p>Few repos that you can use as examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">serverless</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">joomla</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope this article helped you to have an brief idea about how to start an open source project with Github.</p>\n<p>references: <a href=\"https://opensource.com/life/15/12/why-open-source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">why open source</a></p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Going Open Source with Github","date":"February 01, 2018","spoiler":"how to go open-source with Github"},"fields":{"slug":"/going-opensource/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/going-opensource/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-contribute-definitelytyped/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"how-to-contribute-definitelytyped"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to contribute to DefinitelyTyped in Github"}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}
